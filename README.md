## Hello World

This will probably just be used to test the code for my actual website as I work on it. I don't know what I'm doing, but I refuse to use someone else's code. There is a theme on here already that I will figure out how to get rid of, but the instructions told me to do it, and I don't question authority because I'm a wimp.
